# Understanding and Forecasting Household Electricity Consumption


- **Project Concept:**\
Analysis and forecasting of household electricity consumption using machine learning models based on time series data.

- **Objective:**\
Development of a predictive model to optimize energy distribution and reduce waste; applying exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model comparison (including Gradient Boosting and LSTM).

- **Technologies:**\
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, statsmodels (ARIMA), LSTM (Keras), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter, Time Series Resampling
